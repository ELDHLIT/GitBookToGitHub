# .Upgrading the software from the Web interface vRev.K

This type of upgrade of the XOS software requires an external FTP server.

From the **Platform Configuration** tile:

1. Click the “gear” icon and select **Upgrade.**
2.  Type the URL on the file containing the new software on the FTP server accessible from the C\&C network. The file to download must have a .bin extension.

    Note

    If you use a FTP server with a standard account use the following syntax in the URL:

    ```
    ftp://<ftp_account_name>:<ftp_account_password>@<ftp_server_address>/<ftp_directory>/<bin_file_name>
    ```
3.  When the download is completed (around 15 minutes), click **YES** to activate the new software.



    Warning

    The unit automatically restarts. The restart can last several minutes.
