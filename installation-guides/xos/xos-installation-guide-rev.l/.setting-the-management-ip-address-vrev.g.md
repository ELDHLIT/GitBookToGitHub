# .Setting the management IP address vRev.G

To access the XOS through the NMX or Web UI you must set the Management Network parameters of the XOS: IP address, netmask, and gateway on your local IP network.

You can use the following two ways to change IP parameters:

* Using the Web UI commands through the default factory IP address  (Default IP address - [https://192.168.1.200](https://192.168.1.200/)).
* Using the Linux commands through the Local Console .

**What do to next**:

When you finish, use the Control & Command PC (NMX server or PC for Stand-alone mode) to ping the platform management IP address. Once the connection is established, you can perform the remaining platform configuration.

Using 172.17.x.x networks can create conflicts with internal XOS IP network.  If you need to use this network range, please contact support for a custom setting of your product.
