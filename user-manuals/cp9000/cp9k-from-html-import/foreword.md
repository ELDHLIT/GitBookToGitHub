# Foreword

The aim of the front panel is not to replace the Management System but to provide a basic control/command interface for the main settings.

Device operation via its front panel is generally limited to:

* changing basic settings (IP settings, etc.).
* displaying equipment codes and serial numbers.
* displaying installed software releases.
* displaying raised alarms.
* recalling predefined configurations. These configurations are defined via the Web Interface or in-factory. For more information, see section Web Browser Interface.
* displaying equipment internal temperature.
* rebooting the equipment.
