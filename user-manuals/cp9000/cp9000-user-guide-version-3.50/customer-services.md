# Customer Services

Harmonic Global Service and Support has many Technical Assistance Centers (TAC) located globally, but virtually co-located where our customers can obtain technical assistance or request on-site visits from the Regional Field Service Management team. The TAC operates a Follow-The-Sun support model to provide Global Technical Support anytime, anywhere, through a single case management and virtual telephone system. Depending on time of day, anywhere in the world, we will receive and address your calls or emails in one of our global support centers. The Follow-the-Sun model greatly benefits our customers by providing continuous problem resolution and escalation of issues around the clock.
