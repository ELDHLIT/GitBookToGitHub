# Mounting in the rack

Rack mounting is not mandatory for the ViBE CP9000 but the ventilation and safety requirements given in this section must be observed in all cases.

CAUTION:

The chassis must not be fixed with its rack mounting ears only. If you intend to install it in a rack, L-profiles are required and you must observe the ventilation and safety instructions described in the following sections.

* **ViBE CP9000 installation requirements**\
  This section lists the principles to be observed and the steps to be taken when installing the CP9000 in a 19" rack.
* **Ventilation**\
  Please note that product failure rates are increased by high temperatures. The following precautions should therefore be observed:
* **Cabling**\
  It is essential to separate the power supply cables from the signal cables. When facing the rear of the rack (as the equipment is connected via the rear panel), the power supply cables must be guided to the left of the chassis and the signal cables to the right.
* **EMC ground**\
  The EMC connection is required to ensure ground equipotentiality between the different devices in the technical center (only one connection is required per device).
* **Power supply and protective ground**
