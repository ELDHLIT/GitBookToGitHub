# .Setting the management IP address vRev.E

Use the system console to configure the IP address of the platform.

1. Connect a monitor to the device VGA port and a keyboard to a USB port.
2. At the **vosflex login** prompt, enter the user name _harmonic_ and then enter the password _harmonic_.
3. At the **vosflex.localdomain $** prompt, enter _nmi_.
4. Check the DNS: _nmi get dns_ (if there is any address here go to step 5 otherwise go straight to step 6).
5. Clear the DNS: _nmi set dns_.
6. Enter _nmi set network --ip \<static\_ip>/\<netmask> --gw \<static\_gateway>_. Example: 192.168.1.10/24 --gw 192.168.1.1
   * To use DHCP to assign an IP address: _nmi set network --dhcp_
7. At the **vosflex.localdomain $** prompt, enter _showip_ to verify that the IP configuration you entered was successfully applied to the management interface.
8. At the **vosflex.localdomain $** prompt, enter _nmi get dns_ to view any DNS setting.
9. Power cycle the unit (not necessary if there was no DNS identified in step 4).

**What do to next**:

When you finish, use the Control & Command PC (NMX server or PC for Stand-alone mode) to ping the platform management IP address. Once the connection is established, you can perform the remaining platform configuration.

Using 172.17.x.x networks can create conflicts with internal XOS IP network.  If you need to use this network range, please contact support for a custom setting of your product.
