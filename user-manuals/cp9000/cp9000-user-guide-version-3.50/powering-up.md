# Powering up

**Note:** Check that ViBE CP9000 is not yet connected to the LAN as factory-set IP addresses may cause disturbance on the LAN when CP9000 is switched on (address conflict).

Connect the power cords. On the LCD screen the following message **“ViBE launching”** is displayed during the boot.

After a start-up phase, the equipment will become operational. When the equipment is switched on, the last stored configuration will be active.
